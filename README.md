# Machine Learning Web Application for Predicting Employee Churn

## Overview

In the past, the focus has primarily been on 'rates' such as attrition and retention rates. HR Managers compute these rates and attempt to predict future rates using data warehousing tools. While these rates provide an aggregate impact of churn, they only tell half the story. Another approach is to focus on individual records in addition to the aggregate.

There are numerous case studies available on customer churn. In customer churn, you can predict who and when a customer will stop buying. Employee churn is similar to customer churn but focuses on employees rather than customers. Here, you can predict who and when an employee will terminate their service. Employee churn is expensive, and even incremental improvements can yield significant results. This helps in designing better retention plans and improving employee satisfaction.

 ## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training and evaluation.
- **Pickle**: For loading the trained machine learning model.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
